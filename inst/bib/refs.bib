	in the serotonin transporter gene was related to college students'
	reports of relief drinking (drinking-to-cope motives) and whether
	it moderated the associations between negative life events and drinking
	to cope. We examined reward drinking (drinking-to-enhance motives)
	as a comparison and to see whether these effects varied across gender.Using
	an Internet-based survey, college students (N = 360; 192 women) self-reported
	on drinking motives and negative life events for up to 4 years. Study
	participants provided saliva for genotyping the triallelic (LA vs
	LG or S) variants of 5-HTTLPR.Among men, individuals with two risk
	alleles (LG or S), compared with individuals with the LA/LA allele,
	displayed lower drinking-to-cope motives. Among women, individuals
	with one risk allele (either LG or S), compared with individuals
	with the LA/LA allele, displayed stronger drinking-to-enhance motives.
	The association between yearly changes in negative life events and
	drinking-to-cope motives varied across 5-HTTLPR genotype and gender
	and was strongest in the positive direction for women with the LA/LA
	variant.Our findings are not consistent with prior speculation that
	stronger positive associations between life stress and alcohol use
	among individuals with the LG or S allele are the result of increased
	use of alcohol as a method for coping with stress. The importance
	of examining gender differences in the relations between 5-HTTLPR,
	substance use, and related constructs is also noted.},

	study is the conjoint, prospective examination of these risk factors
	in a 10-year longitudinal study of adults who were at-risk drinkers
	at baseline.Prospective, population-based cohort of drinkers aged
	18 or older from a Northeastern U.S. area initially evaluated for
	history of alcohol use disorders and drinking motives in 1991 to
	1992. New onset dependence was studied in those who never met the
	criteria for alcohol dependence at baseline (n = 423), and new onset
	abuse was studied in those who never met the criteria for alcohol
	abuse at baseline (n = 301) and who did not develop dependence during
	the follow-up.Family history significantly interacted with 2 baseline
	drinking motives in predicting new onsets of DSM-IV alcohol dependence:
	drinking to reduce negative affect (OR 3.38; 95\% CI 1.05, 10.9)
	and drinking for social facilitation (OR 3.88; CI 1.21, 12.5). Effects
	were stronger after conditioning the drinking motives on having a
	positive family history of alcoholism. In contrast, in predicting
	new onsets of alcohol abuse, drinking motives did not have direct
	effects or interact with family history.Those who drank to reduce
	negative affect or for social facilitation at baseline were at greater
	risk of alcohol dependence 10 years later if they also had a family
	history of alcoholism. These results suggest an at-risk group that
	can be identified prior to the development of alcohol dependence.
	Further, the findings suggest utility in investigating the interaction
	of drinking motives with measured genetic polymorphisms in predicting
	alcohol dependence.},

	this co-occurrence, researchers are beginning to evaluate specific
	drinking-related factors, including alcohol use motives, among socially
	anxious individuals. Drawing on Cooper's (1994) 4-factor model of
	drinking motives (enhancement, social, conformity, coping), a growing
	body of work suggests that socially anxious individuals may consume
	alcohol in an effort to cope with their anxious symptoms; however,
	no study to date has examined these relations among youth. Accordingly,
	we examined alcohol use motives as a function of social anxiety in
	a community-based sample of 50 adolescents ages 12 to 17 years (Mage
	= 16.35, SD = 1.10). As predicted, heightened social anxiety was
	associated with elevated coping-related drinking motives. More important,
	other alcohol-use motives did not vary as a function of social anxiety.
	Collectively, these findings uniquely extend research conducted with
	adults, and suggest socially anxious youth may be motivated to use
	alcohol to manage their anxious arousal.},

	sensitivity to alcohol-related outcomes via coping drinking motives
	in college women. Further, the impact of emotion dysregulation on
	the mediational path between anxiety sensitivity and alcohol-related
	outcomes was investigated. Method: A sample of 223 female undergraduate
	drinkers from a midwestern university completed self-report surveys
	assessing alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, anxiety
	sensitivity, coping drinking motives, and emotion dysregulation.
	Results: Anxiety sensitivity was indirectly related to both alcohol-related
	problems and alcohol use via coping motives. The indirect effect
	of anxiety sensitivity on alcohol-related problems (but not alcohol
	use) was qualified by the level of emotion dysregulation. As individuals
	reported more emotion dysregulation, the strength of the relation
	between coping drinking motives and alcohol-related problems increased.
	Conclusions: Results replicate and extend the link between anxiety
	sensitivity and alcohol outcomes via the mechanism of negative reinforcement,
	and they further support the importance of emotion dysregulation
	in explaining alcohol-related problems among college women. Implications
	for treatment and prevention of alcohol-related problems in college
	women are discussed. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 75, 83-92, 2014).},

  abstract = {Drinking motives are among the most proximal factors for drinking
	behavior and serve as a mechanism through which more distal factors
	are mediated. However, it is less clear whether drinking motives
	are precursors of drinking or, in contrast, shaped by previous drinking
	experiences (reciprocal effects), or both. Moreover, in adults it
	is unclear whether drinking motives, usually shaped in adolescence,
	influence each other over time. In this longitudinal study (N = 2440,
	47\% women, average age 53 years), drinking motives and drinking
	behavior (i.e., number of drinks on the heaviest drinking day and
	number of drinking days; both during the past week) were assessed
	at 2 time points, separated by 3 months. Full cross-lagged regression
	models revealed that drinking motives were positively associated
	with drinking behavior over time and that drinking motives are shaped
	by the number of drinking days (i.e., reciprocal effects). Furthermore,
	coping and enhancement motives, as well as social and conformity
	motives, positively reinforced each other. Moreover, social motives
	were positively associated with enhancement motives over time. In
	conclusion, drinking motives influence each other over a 3-month
	period in adulthood and predict drinking behavior over time, making
	them important candidates for prevention efforts. Drinking motives
	are likely to be modifiable and might be used to stimulate drinking
	decrease.},

	a patient aged 14 to 18 in treatment for personality pathology. Clinicians
	completed the CBCL (parent-report version) and measures of adaptive

	history, which served as criterion variables to test the validity
	of the CBCL as completed by clinicians. Most CBCL scales demonstrated
	acceptable reliability. Validity estimates were impressive, and the
	data revealed clinically meaningful associations between specific
	CBCL scale scores and developmental and family history variables.
	Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the factorial structure
	of the clinician-report CBCL resembled that of the parent-report
	CBCL, with the exception of a substantially lower correlation between
	higher order internalizing and externalizing factors. The data suggest
	that clinical judgment can be both reliable and valid when quantified

	dependence is that a cluster of individuals who endorse a subthreshold
	number of dependence criteria and no abuse criteria do not receive
	a formal diagnosis; despite elevated risk for alcohol-related problems
	relative to those with an abuse diagnosis. These individuals have
	been referred to as diagnostic orphans. The primary aim of this study
	was to examine alcohol use correlates of a group of diagnostic orphans
	in a sample of 396 nontreatment seeking college students who reported
	drinking on at least one occasion in the last 90 days. DSM-IV criteria
	were assessed using a modified version of the Composite International
	Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module (CIDI-SAM). Diagnostic
	orphans represented 34.1\% (n = 135) of the original sample who did
	not receive a formal diagnosis; with the most frequently endorsed
	dependence criteria being tolerance and drinking larger/longer amounts
	than intended. Diagnostic orphans reported a range of alcohol-related
	negative consequences and reported greater frequencies of social
	and enhancement drinking motives in comparison to coping motives.
	They were similar to alcohol abusers and dissimilar to those with
	dependence or those without a diagnosis on alcohol consumption, alcohol
	problem severity, drinking motives and restraint variables. The present
	findings indicate that diagnostic orphans in college students represent
	a distinct group of drinkers who may be at risk for the development
	of alcohol use disorders and may be in need of intervention, given
	their similarity to those with an abuse diagnosis. Prevention and
	intervention efforts across college campuses should target this group
	to prevent escalation of alcohol problem severity.},

	behaviors is lacking. This study was designed to assess the direct
	and indirect influences of poor mental health (a latent factor consisting
	of depression, anxiety, and stress) to alcohol use and alcohol-related
	consequences through the mediators of global sleep quality and drinking
	motives in a comprehensive model.Participants were 1,044 heavy-drinking
	college students (66.3\% female) who completed online surveys.A hybrid
	structural equation model tested hypotheses involving relations leading
	from poor mental health to drinking motives and poorer global sleep
	quality to drinking outcomes. Results showed that poor mental health
	significantly predicted all four subscales of drinking motivations
	(social, coping, conformity, and enhancement) as well as poor sleep.
	Most of the drinking motives and poor sleep were found to explain
	alcohol use and negative alcohol consequences. Poor sleep predicted
	alcohol consequences, even after controlling for all other variables
	in the model. The hypothesized mediational pathways were examined
	with tests of indirect effects.This is the first study to assess
	concomitantly the relationships among three vital health-related
	domains (mental health, sleep behavior, and alcohol risk) in college
	students. Findings offer important implications for college personnel
	and interventionists interested in reducing alcohol risk by focusing
	on alleviating mental health problems and poor sleep quality.},

	highly prevalent and comorbid conditions associated with a significant
	level of impairment. Little systematic study has focused on gender
	differences specific to individuals with both AD and PTSD. The current
	study examined gender-specific associations between PTSD symptom
	severity, drinking to cope (i.e., reduce negative affect), drinking
	for enhancement (i.e., increase positive affect), and average alcohol
	use in a clinical sample of men (n = 46) and women (n = 46) with
	comorbid AD and PTSD. Results indicated that PTSD symptoms were highly
	associated with drinking-to-cope motives for both men and women,
	but with greater drinking for enhancement motives for men only. Enhancement
	motives were positively associated with average alcohol quantity
	for both men and women, but coping motives were significantly associated
	with average alcohol quantity for women only. These findings suggest
	that for individuals with comorbid AD and PTSD, interventions that
	focus on reducing PTSD symptoms are likely to lower coping motives
	for both genders, and targeting coping motives is likely to result
	in decreased drinking for women but not for men, whereas targeting
	enhancement motives is likely to lead to reduced drinking for both
	genders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).},

	variance in drinking and alcohol-related problems. However, they
	have been developed to test different theories of drinking and have
	rarely been directly compared with one another. Thus, their comparative
	utility is unclear. The current study examined five alcohol-related
	variants of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) in a sample of 300
	undergraduates and sought to establish their predictive validity.
	Results indicated that the Drinking Identity IAT, which measured
	associations of "drinker" with "me," was the most consistent predictor
	of alcohol consumption, alcohol problems, and alcohol cravings. It
	also had the highest internal consistency and test-retest reliability
	scores. The results for the Alcohol Excitement and Alcohol Approach
	IATs were also promising, but their psychometric properties were
	less consistent. Although the two IATs were positively correlated
	with all of the drinking outcome variables, they did not consistently
	predict unique variance in those variables after controlling for
	explicit measures. They also had relatively lower internal consistencies
	and test-retest reliabilities. Ultimately, results suggested that
	implicit drinking identity may be a useful tool for predicting alcohol
	consumption, problems, and cravings and a potential target for prevention
	and intervention efforts.},

	Bayesian analysis of genetic-association-study data. A key feature
	of our approach is the ability to combine different submodels together,
	almost arbitrarily, for dealing with the complexities of real data.
	In particular, we propose various techniques for selecting the "best"
	subset of genetic predictors for a specific phenotype (or set of
	phenotypes). At the same time, we may control for complex, non-linear
	relationships between phenotypes and additional (non-genetic) covariates
	as well as accounting for any residual correlation that exists among
	multiple phenotypes. Both of these additional modelling components
	are shown to potentially aid in detecting the underlying genetic
	signal. We may also account for uncertainty regarding missing genotype
	data. Indeed, at the heart of our approach is a novel method for
	reconstructing unobserved haplotypes and/or inferring the values
	of missing genotypes. This can be deployed independently or, alternatively,
	it can be fully integrated into arbitrary genotype- or haplotype-based
	association models such that the missing data and the association
	model are "estimated" simultaneously. The impact of such simultaneous
	analysis on inferences drawn from the association model is shown
	to be potentially significant. Our modelling components are packaged
	as an "add-on" interface to the widely used WinBUGS software, which
	allows Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of a wide range of statistical
	models. We illustrate their use with a series of increasingly complex
	analyses conducted on simulated data based on a real pharmacogenetic
	example.},

	based on a motivational style of responding. Adult twin studies typically
	estimate the heritability of alcohol use motives to be between 7
	and 42\%, although relatively little is known about genetic and environmental
	influences upon alcohol use motives in adolescence.Latent class analysis
	(LCA) models containing 1 through 5 classes were fitted to the data
	derived from 1,422 adolescent twin and siblings self-reported alcohol
	use motives. Using twin models, we estimated the genetic, shared,
	and nonshared environmental influences to the class membership data
	derived from the LCA.Four drinking motives classes were identified
	(family-oriented, social, enhancement/social, and coping/social).
	The coping/social and enhancement/social classes were differentiated
	from the social class on measures of depression, delinquency, and
	aggressive behavior. Analyses indicated that nonadditive genetic
	factors accounted for 76\% of the variance in the coping/social motives
	class and additive genetic influences accounted for 66\% of the variance

	genetic factors and shared environmental factors influencing class
	membership of enhancement/social motivated drinkers (28 and 20\%
	explained variance, respectively). Substantial shared environmental
	influences were revealed for membership of the family-oriented class
	(75\%).Heritable influences may predispose individuals to drink to
	cope with negative affect, for social reasons, and to a lesser extent
	for enhancement. Familial environmental influences shape family-oriented

	alcohol use and the likelihood of experiencing alcohol-related problems
	are related, it is possible that additional factors strengthen the
	magnitude of this relationship. The purpose of the present study
	was to assess the moderating effect of two such factors: negative
	affect and coping drinking motives.Data were collected on 316 college
	students at a midsized, public university in the upper Midwest who
	reported using alcohol.Findings indicated that both negative affect
	and coping drinking motives moderated the alcohol use-alcohol problems
	relationship. The three-way interaction indicated that the strongest
	relationship between alcohol use and alcohol-related problems existed
	for individuals high in both negative affect and coping drinking
	motives.This study suggests that college students high in negative
	affect and coping drinking motives are particularly at risk for experiencing
	problems as a result of their alcohol use, indicating that clinicians
	should consider screening for these factors when conducting alcohol-related
	prevention and intervention efforts.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Objective: Although college students experience a diverse
	range of alcohol consequences, most studies focus on global, rather
	than distinct, consequence types. One predictor of unique consequences-drinking
	motives-has been studied only cross-sectionally. We aimed to examine
	the prediction of unique alcohol consequence domains (social/interpersonal,
	academic/occupational, risky behavior, impaired control, poor self-care,
	diminished self-perception, blackout drinking, and physiological
	dependence) by coping and enhancement motives over the course of
	one year. We hypothesized that coping motives would directly predict
	and that enhancement motives would indirectly (through alcohol use)
	predict unique consequences. Method: Web surveys were administered
	to a sample of college students (n = 552, 62\% female) at the beginning
	of the fall semester for 2 consecutive academic years. Structural
	equation modeling was used to test direct and indirect paths from
	motives to consequences. Results: The data supported hypothesized
	direct, prospective paths from coping motives to several alcohol
	consequences (impaired control, diminished self-perception, poor
	self-care, risky behaviors, academic/occupational, and physiological
	dependence). These associations were not mediated by alcohol consumption.
	Enhancement motives were indirectly associated with all eight consequence
	domains by way of increased alcohol use at follow-up. Models were
	invariant across gender, year in school, and symptoms of posttraumatic
	stress. Conclusions: Findings suggest that whether motives act as
	a final common pathway to problem drinking may depend on which motives
	and which drinking outcomes are examined. As coping motives demonstrate
	a direct link to unique alcohol problem types over time, individuals
	endorsing these motives may need to be prioritized for intervention.

	in which positive and negative experiences motivate drinking in unique
	social contexts (e.g., M. L. Cooper, M. R. Frone, M. Russell & P.
	Mudar, 1995, Drinking to regulate positive and negative emotions:
	A motivational model of alcohol use, Journal of Personality and Social
	Psychology, Vol. 69, pp. 990-1005). Daily process methodology, in
	which daily events, moods, and drinking behaviors are reported daily
	or multiple times per day, has been used to examine behavioral patterns
	that are consistent with discrete motivations. We advance the notion
	that repeated patterns of drinking in various social contexts as
	a function of positive or negative mood increases can provide evidence
	of individual-level if-then drinking signatures, which in turn can
	predict drinking-related outcomes. The purpose of this study was
	to examine the utility of slopes to predict longer term drinking
	motivations and alcohol problems by employing a daily-process study
	of nonclinical moderate alcohol drinkers (N = 47; 49\% women). Participants
	responded to thrice daily interviews administered via handheld computer
	for 30 days, followed by a longitudinal telephone survey for 12 months.
	Participants' daily mood-drinking relationships were extracted from
	hierarchical linear modeling and employed as predictors of 12-month
	outcomes in multiple regression analyses. Daily mood-drinking patterns
	demonstrated significant variability across persons, such that moderate
	drinkers could be reliably differentiated based on those patterns
	in terms of distinct drinking-related outcomes. Among the results,
	negative-mood-solitary-drinking slopes were associated with lower
	subsequent coping motives but positive-mood-solitary-drinking slopes
	were predictive of higher coping and lower social motives. Conversely,
	positive-mood-social-drinking associations were predictive of higher
	enhancement motives and brief Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test
	scores. Results are interpreted in light of motivational models of

	the previous month. In addition to providing demographic information
	(gender and fraternity/sorority membership) participants completed
	Web-based assessments of social norms (perceived descriptive norms
	regarding typical student drinking, injunctive norms regarding friends'
	and parents' approval), motives (social, enhancement, coping, and
	conformity), and expectancies and evaluations of positive and negative

	injunctive norms were among the best predictors of college student
	drinking. With respect to alcohol problems, results indicated that
	coping motives accounted for the largest proportion of unique variance.
	Finally, results revealed that alcohol consumption mediated the relationships
	between predictors and problems for social norms, whereas coping
	motives, negative expectancies, and evaluation of negative effects
	were directly associated with alcohol problems despite having relatively
	weak or null unique associations with consumption.The results of
	this study substantiate social norms as being among the best predictors
	of alcohol consumption in this population and suggest that drinking
	to cope is a better predictor of problems. The findings are discussed
	in terms of practical prevention and treatment implications.},

	consistency and concurrent validity were also evaluated in all 15
	countries.CFA revealed that the fit indices of 2-factor or 3-factor
	models were consistently better than fit indices for a 1-factor model
	in 14 of 15 countries. Comparisons of BIC values indicated that the
	2-factor solution was the best fitted model. Factorial invariance
	tests in data from 3 countries indicated that the factor loadings
	and thresholds of the AUDIT were invariant across gender. The internal
	reliability and concurrent validity of AUDIT and its subscales were
	acceptable in both genders.A two-factor model best describes AUDIT
	responses across general-population surveys in 12 of 15 countries,
	with acceptable internal reliability and concurrent validity, and
	supports a gender-invariant structure in at least three of those
	countries.},

	review of the literature, a large number of additional studies have
	been published on the AUDIT, abbreviated versions of it, its psychometric
	properties, and the applicability of the AUDIT for a diverse array
	of populations. The current article summarizes new findings and integrates
	them with results of previous research. It also suggests some issues
	that we believe are particularly in need of further study.A growing
	body of research evidence supports the criterion validity of English
	version of the AUDIT as a screen for alcohol dependence as well as
	for less severe alcohol problems. Nevertheless, the cut-points for
	effective detection of hazardous drinking as well as identification
	of alcohol dependence or harmful use in women need to be lowered
	from the originally recommended value of 8 points. The AUDIT-C, the
	most popular short version of the AUDIT consisting solely of its
	3 consumption items, is approximately equal in accuracy to the full
	AUDIT. Psychometric properties of the AUDIT, such as test-retest
	reliability and internal consistency, are quite favorable. Continued
	research is urged to establish the psychometric properties of non-English
	versions of the AUDIT, use of the AUDIT with adolescents and with
	older adults, and selective inclusion of alcohol biomarkers with
	the AUDIT in some instances.Research continues to support use of
	the AUDIT as a means of screening for the spectrum of alcohol use

  abstract = {The last 20 years have seen a significant paradigm shift in how we
	view alcohol misuse. The dichotomous model of "alcoholism" and "normal
	drinking" has now been replaced by the concept of a spectrum of disorders.
	In this new framework, "hazardous alcohol use" is defined as a repeated
	pattern of drinking that confers the risk of harmful consequences.
	It is a typical example of a subthreshold disorder. Where actual
	physical or psychological harm or social problems have occurred,
	the terms "harmful alcohol use" and "alcohol abuse," respectively,
	are applied. These conditions would typically be considered to be
	above the clinical threshold. The most severe disorder, alcohol dependence,
	is a psychobiological syndrome with often severe physical, psychological,
	and social sequelae. This article describes how the concept of hazardous
	alcohol use originated, and reviews the intervention techniques that
	have been developed to induce and assist hazardous drinkers to reduce
	their consumption to nonhazardous levels. The findings from a series
	of World Health Organization (WHO) collaborative studies on brief
	interventions for hazardous alcohol use are described. This work
	has resulted in the development of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
	Test (AUDIT) screening instrument, which can detect over 90\% of
	hazardous drinkers in a range of settings, and the demonstration
	that 5 minutes' structured advice can reduce hazardous consumption
	by 30\%. The later phases of this program of work have examined strategies
	to promote the dissemination of brief interventions for hazardous
	alcohol use throughout primary health care, and the nationwide, systematic,
	and sustained utilization of these interventions.},

	models predicting drinking to cope in a sample of emerging adult

	would be indirectly related to drinking to cope via associations

	support a novel model of the relation between secondary negative

	It is based on Bayesian modeling and inference, treating the number
	of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) as an unobserved random variable
	and using ideas similar to composite interval mapping to account
	for the effects of QTLs in other chromosomes. The method is introduced
	for inbred lines and it can be applied also in situations involving
	frequent missing genotypes. We propose that two new probabilistic
	measures be used to summarize the results from the statistical analysis:
	(1) the (posterior) QTL intensity, for estimating the number of QTLs
	in a chromosome and for localizing them into some particular chromosomal
	regions, and (2) the locationwise (posterior) distributions of the
	phenotypic effects of the QTLs. Both these measures will be viewed
	as functions of the putative QTL locus, over the marker range in
	the linkage group. The method is tested and compared with standard
	interval and composite interval mapping techniques by using simulated
	backcross progeny data. It is implemented as a software package.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Objective: Stress evokes thoughts about alcohol and enhances
	alcohol's rewarding value in drinkers who use alcohol to cope with
	negative affect. The present study extends prior research by examining
	whether this effect applies to actual alcohol consumption following
	a stressor and whether individuals with high and low coping motives
	for drinking differ in stress reactivity. Method: Nondependent drinkers
	with high scores (Ôπ•1 SD above national norms) on the coping motives
	subscale on the Drinking Motives Questionnaire (n = 41; 46\% women)
	were enrolled along with age- and gender-matched nondependent drinkers
	with low coping motives (n = 41). Participants were randomized to
	receive the Trier Social Stress Test or a no-stress control condition.
	Following the stress manipulation, participants could consume up
	to 473 ml of beer in a "taste test," a covert measure of alcohol
	consumption. Stress reactivity was measured with both objective and
	subjective indices, and milliliters of beer consumed was the alcohol-relevant
	outcome. Results: Participants with high coping motives showed a
	less robust stress response to the Trier Social Stress Test than
	participants with low coping motives for drinking. However, the stressor
	did not result in greater consumption of alcohol (i.e., no main effect
	of stress induction) or differential drinking in the two motive groups
	(i.e., no Stressor √ó Coping Motive group interaction). Conclusions:
	Findings suggest that nondependent drinkers with and without coping
	motives for drinking may experience a stress provocation differently,
	but exposure to a standardized social stressor does not lead to differential
	drinking in these groups in a clinical laboratory setting. (J. Stud.

	no study has investigated the underlying mechanisms of adolescent
	victims' engagement with alcohol. This current study investigated
	the development of risky coping drinking motives as a mediator in
	the relationship between adolescent school victimisation and alcohol-related
	problem behaviour using a longitudinal design over 12 months.We recruited
	324 participants, aged 13 to 15 from schools across London, England.
	Participants were surveyed during class time at 2 time points: baseline
	and 12 months. At both time points participants answered questions
	related to bullying victimisation, alcohol-related problem behaviour,
	drinking motives and the quantity by frequency of alcohol consumption.The
	relationships between victimisation, drinking and drinking motives
	were investigated using Pearson correlations. Path analysis showed
	that victimisation leads both directly and indirectly, through coping
	motives to alcohol-related problems, rather than to the quantity
	and frequency of alcohol use. Significance of mediation was tested
	using 5000 bias corrected and accelerated bootstrapped intervals.
	Baseline victimisation was significantly correlated with baseline
	alcohol-related problem behaviour and predictive of future problems
	at 12 months. Drinking to cope at 12 months partially mediated the
	relationship between baseline victimisation and alcohol-related problems
	at 12 months.Results show that victims of bullying are drinking alcohol
	in a risky style, partly due to the development of self medicating
	drinking behaviour. Victims of bullying could therefore benefit from
	coping skills interventions targeting negative affect regulation
	in order to reduce the risk for future alcohol misuse.},

	factors can be assessed with a brief questionnaire (AEMax), related
	to the circumplex model of emotion. I argue that negative reinforcement,
	one of the three basic expectancy factors, is not assessed with the
	AEMax. Importantly, negative reinforcement is positively related
	to problem drinking while sedation (the AEMax-factor that comes closest)
	is not. In a new dataset (from 119 students, collected in 2002),
	I demonstrate that sedation is related to negative expectancies and
	not to negative reinforcement. Different ways to assess all major
	expectancy factors are proposed.},

	of same-sex (e.g., mother-daughter) and opposite-sex (e.g., mother-son)
	associations for drinking motives across four pairings of parent-young
	adult child dyads.Three waves of data spanning approximately 10 years
	in early to late young adulthood were used in conjunction with mother
	and father data to examine same-and cross-sex associations for drinking
	motives. Multiple group structural equation modeling was used to
	statistically model and evaluate these parent-young adult associations.Findings
	indicated strong same-sex intergenerational transmission patterns
	for mother-daughter dyads relative to father-daughter dyads. The
	strength of relationships for father-son dyads was also stronger
	and significantly different than those for father-daughter dyads.
	There were no statistically significant differences between sex-specific
	intergenerational patterns for mother-son and father-son dyads or
	for mother-daughter and mother-son dyads. Although there was some
	generality and some specificity in the sex-specific intergenerational
	transmission patterns of drinking motives, when statistically significant,
	the transmission pattern generalized across all three drinking motives
	(coping, social, and enhancement). CoNCLUSIONS: Intergenerational
	factors contributing to alcohol phenotypes may not be limited to
	the modeling of alcohol use or the occurrence of alcohol disorders
	but may also include cognitive-motivational systems of affective
	regulation related to the use of alcohol. Future research would benefit
	by focusing on how biogenetic and socialization factors contribute
	to same- and opposite-sex intergenerational patterns and how to use
	this information to strengthen intervention programs.},
